        There are many ways to run notebooks. You can run them right within this
        environment, on Microsoft Learn, and in fact in several of this path's
        modules you will run notebooks. In this module, however, you will learn
        how to get set up to run notebooks locally by using Visual Studio Code.
        Before we start, take a look at this video tutorial on YouTube. The
        video explains how to download Python, get set up in Visual Studio Code,
        and run a notebook locally. To start building your notebook, you need to
        have the following software available on your computer:
      </p>

        If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you need to
        download it. On a Mac, go to Python.org to install the latest version
        compatible with your operating system. On Windows, go to the Microsoft
        Store to download the most recent version. If you already have Python
        installed, you might need to update your installation to the latest
        version. Make sure you have Python 3 by typing python3 --version in your
        terminal or command line. If it is installed, the version will be
        displayed.
      </p>

        When these two installations are complete, you'll then need to install a
        Visual Studio Code extension. This extension allows you to run Jupyter
        notebooks from within Visual Studio Code by using a kernel. A kernel in
        Visual Studio Code helps you activate an Anaconda environment, so you
        can run your notebooks by using your Python installation. In Visual
        Studio Code, from extensions panel on the left, search for Jupyter by
        Microsoft. To install this extension, select Install.
