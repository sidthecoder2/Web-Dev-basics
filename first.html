        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
        subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may
        be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
        adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
        called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
        were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
        BC).[1][2] Humans now keepchickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one of
        the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
        of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4]
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[4] There are
        numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
        religion, and in language and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,
        Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
        Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known
        in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
        every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar,
        Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
